Once upon a time, in a ADJECTIVE kingdom far away, there lived a ADJECTIVE NOUN. 
Every day, it would VERB ADVERB around the NOUN, making everyone in the kingdom VERB with joy. 
One day, a ADJECTIVE NOUN visited the kingdom and offered the NOUN a ADJECTIVE gift. 
It was a NOUN that could VERB ADVERB. 
The NOUN was so ADJECTIVE, it decided to VERB the gift ADVERB. 
And from that day forward, the NOUN VERB ADVERB, bringing ADJECTIVE happiness to all.
